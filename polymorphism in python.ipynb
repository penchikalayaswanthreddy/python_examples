    "In inheritance, the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. \n",
    "However, it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has inherited from the parent class. \n",
    "This is particularly useful in cases where the method inherited from the parent class doesnâ€™t quite fit the child class.\n",
    "In such cases, we re-implement the method in the child class. \n",
