    "The process of wrapping up variables and methods into a single entity is known as Encapsulation. \n",
    "It is one of the underlying concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). \n",
    "It acts as a protective shield that puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly,\n",
    "and can prevent accidental or unauthorized modification of data. \n",

    "Access modifiers limit access to the variables and functions of a class. \n",
    "Python uses three types of access modifiers; they are - private, public and protected.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Public members are accessible anywhere from the class. All the member variables of the class are by default public.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Protected members are accessible within the class and also available to its sub-classes. \n",
    "To define a protected member, prefix the member name with a single underscore “_”.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Private members are accessible within the class.\n",
    "To define a private member, prefix the member name with a double underscore “__”.\n",
